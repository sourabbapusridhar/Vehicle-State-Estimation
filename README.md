# Extended Kalman Filter

This repository has the design and implementation of an extended kalman filter used for vehicle state estimation and localization.

The vehicle state estimation and localization is calculated using two [Intertial Measurement Units](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST_BNO055_DS000_12.pdf) and one [GPS sensor](https://www.swiftnav.com/latest/piksi-multi-hw-specification).
